# Purpose

## What This Tool Is

The **AdFixus ROI Calculator** is a sales enablement tool designed to help Vox Media (and AdFixus sales teams) project the financial return on investment from implementing AdFixus's identity resolution technology across Vox Media's digital property portfolio.

## Problem It Solves

Publishers like Vox Media face three critical challenges in the post-cookie era:

1. **Safari/iOS Addressability Loss**: Safari's ITP limits cookie lifespan to 7 days, causing publishers to lose returning user identity and ~30% of addressable inventory value
2. **CAPI Complexity**: Conversion API implementations are fragmented and costly to maintain, limiting advertiser performance optimization
3. **CDP Bloat**: Without durable identity, customer data platforms accumulate duplicate user records (1 user = 3+ IDs), inflating costs

## Who It's For

| Audience | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Vox Media Ad Sales** | Present ROI projections to internal stakeholders for budget approval |
| **AdFixus Sales Team** | Generate data-backed proposals for enterprise publishers |
| **Publisher Finance/RevOps** | Model scenarios and validate assumptions before commitment |

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goal
Convert Vox Media from prospect to customer by demonstrating clear, credible ROI with:
- **Conservative projections** that build trust
- **Transparent assumptions** that invite validation
- **Domain-specific modeling** reflecting Vox's actual portfolio

### Secondary Goals
- Reduce sales cycle by providing self-serve modeling capability
- Capture leads for follow-up via PDF report generation
- Establish AdFixus as a sophisticated, data-driven partner
