# Purpose

## What This Tool Is

The **AdFixus ROI Simulator** is a sales enablement tool designed for the Vox Media partnership opportunity. It projects the financial return on investment from implementing AdFixus identity resolution technology across Vox Media's digital portfolio.

This is **not** a generic calculator — it's purpose-built with:
- Pre-loaded Vox Media domain data (13 properties, ~203.5M pageviews)
- Vox-specific pricing ($15K POC, $239K annual)
- Audience profiles calibrated for Vox's traffic mix
- PDF proposals co-branded with Vox Media logo

## Problems It Addresses

Publishers like Vox Media face three critical challenges in the post-cookie era:

### 1. Safari/iOS Addressability Loss
Safari's ITP limits cookie lifespan to 7 days. Publishers lose returning user identity on ~35% of traffic, causing:
- Unaddressable Safari inventory sold at remnant rates
- CPM degradation on premium inventory
- Loss of frequency capping and audience targeting

### 2. CAPI Complexity
Conversion API implementations are fragmented. Without unified identity:
- Match rates hover around 30% baseline
- Advertisers can't optimize campaigns effectively
- Publishers lose performance-based budget allocation

### 3. CDP/Identity Bloat
Without durable identity, data platforms accumulate duplicate records:
- 1 real user = 3.5+ IDs (average across industry)
- Inflated CDP licensing costs
- Inaccurate audience segmentation
